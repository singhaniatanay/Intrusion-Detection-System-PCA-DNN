# Readme - Minor Project

This file is guide to the complete project.

# CODE

Above mentioned link is for the Code as a Github Repository. It contains 4 folders as listed below:

1. Notebooks
    - it contains 3 files : Data-Pre-Processing.ipynb, Pytorch-NN.ipynb, and Temp.ipynb
    - As the filename suggests, first notebook contains codes to Pre-processing of Data i.e combining multiple CSVs, cleaning, etc.
    - Second Notebook - Pytorch-NN contains codes to Scaling of Dataset, PCA, Deep Neural Networks. Third notebook is just temp notebook for exploration of dataset.
2. Python Scripts
    - It contains 4 files : dataset_mod.py, dataset_mod_pt2.py, dataset_oversampling.py, feature_reduction.py
    - These files help in working with the dataset i.e processing of the data (Jupyter's Kernel gets stuck due to the large sized dataset).
3. Models
    - It contains 8 Models' parameters saved in files. That is each file can be loaded with the given Deep-Neural Network and one does not have to train it again.
4. Images
    - This contains few figures created for the final report.
